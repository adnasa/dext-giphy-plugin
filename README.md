# WIP

I put this together within a hour to work out the dext plugin system and
until I publish this to npm or something, you're going to have to set it up
manually.

### hackalicious set up

#### 1

```
$ cd ~/.dext/plugins
$ git clone https://github.com/adnasa/dext-giphy-plugin.git .
```

#### 2

Register the plugin in `config.json`

```
{
  "plugins": [
    "dext-github-plugin"
  ]
}
```

and you're done
